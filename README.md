Graphics visualizer and editor
Load gltf files and render using custom OpenGL renderer with added capabilities to edit the model.

File parsing is provided using asset import library (see http://www.assimp.org/). The visualizer though will be designed to specifically cater gltf/glb file types. 

Renderer uses Opengl and I plan to use OpenGL 4.6

Meshing and computation will be added using CGAL libraries.
